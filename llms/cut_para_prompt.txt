[content] = [{content}]
Segment [content] into coherent chunks of around 1000-2000 characters based on semantic meaning and topic shifts.
Preserve closely related content together within segments.
Prioritize semantic coherence over strict character count adherence when splitting paragraphs or sections.
Output the segmented text with clear separators between chunks while maintaining the original content's flow and structure as much as possible.

After segmenting the paragraphs, generate a few core keyword tags for each paragraph.

Output in JSON Format:

    {{
        "paragraph":..., "tags":[...]
    }},...
]
